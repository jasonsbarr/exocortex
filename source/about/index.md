What is meant by this strange word, exocortex? First, a definition:

{% blockquote Bionic Gate http://www.bionicgate.com/exocortex-your-brain-on-internet/ Exocortex (Your Brain On Internet) %}
An exocortex is a theoretical artificial external information processing system that would augment a brain's biological high-level cognitive processes.

An individual's exocortex would be composed of external memory modules, processors, IO devices and software systems that would interact with, and augment, a person's biological brain. Typically this interaction is described as being conducted through a direct brain-computer interface, making these extensions functionally part of the individual's mind.

# exocortex is an extension of my brain

Yes, it's just a blog.

But what is a blog, if not an extension of the writer into the digital domain?

This blog is here for me to take notes on whatever I'm reading about, studying, or thinking about at any given time. It's for processing as-yet _incomplete thoughts_.

This distinguishes it from other personal and/or professional blogs I may have, which are there to present thoughts that are more-or-less fully-formed, insofar as any thought is ever complete.

# to enhance available memory for recall

I may not always be able to remember an exact thought, fact, or bit of information from something I know I've studied before.

If I maintain my exocortex well, I will at least always be able to know where to find such information when it eludes my organic brain's ability to recall it.

Not only that, but the act of writing down my notes and thoughts also gives my organic brain another vector for imprinting the information in its own direct memory.

# this isn't what they mean by "exocortex"

A more proper way to describe this would be as a part of my "extended mind," if one ascribes to that thesis in some form (as I do).

But, let's be real, "exocortex" just sounds a lot cooler.

# exocortex vs. a journal

My journal is only for two things:
1. My daily schedule, goals, tasks, and related items
2. My most private thoughts, which belong to me alone

Those two things may seem incompatible at first glance. I believe that is wrong.

In a paradoxical sense, they belong together because both of those things are ultimately _ephemeral_.

My schedule and goals aren't much use to anyone but me, when I want to track where my time has gone and discover what things I have _truly_ given value over the past [insert arbitrary period of time here], as opposed to the things I _say_ I value and _should_ be valuing.

My private thoughts, likewise, are but mere flashes&ndash;bits of larger pieces that emerge from my daily activities, which need to be drawn out further and given a fuller form before they are ready for me to present in a more public medium.

# exocortex vs. a regular blog

For me, at least, a "regular blog" is a place for thoughts I can consider "fully formed" in the time and place where I write them.

Or, if I am presenting partially-formed ideas or attempting some kind of other dialogue with my prospective readers, it's at least a place where the purpose for its existence is to communicate with others.

Connecting those thoughts with readers is a primary goal with such a blog.

The only reader I care about here is the observer watching as the hands to which its consciousness is attached type these words.

# why publish these thoughts at all?

First, it's easier to retrieve the information stored here when it's available online, as opposed to in a private cloud account where I would need to login and sync a device with the remote provider. Here all I need to do is visit a website and it's all there for me to use.

It might also be useful for someone else, if they are searching for the same kinds of information I record here.
