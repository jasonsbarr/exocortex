Even people with great experience need to revisit the basics from time to time. That's exactly what I'm doing now.

# My history with web development

I've been doing web development in some form since I was 15 years old, when I built my first website.

That was in spring 1995, before JavaScript was a twinkle in Brendan Eich's eye or the W3C released the first CSS recommendation.

I'd like to be able to say I kept up with the latest and greatest web programming techniques my whole life after that. I could tell you I was a ninja web programmer before I turned 20, but that would be a lie.

I did keep building websites for campus and community groups, though, and in 2009 I finally started learning to do for-real web development.

I studied HTML and CSS, including all the cross-browser issues at the time (seriously, you kids don't know how good you have it now).

Shortly thereafter I began to study programming in earnest: PHP on the server, and JavaScript for the browser.

# From academia to being a developer

I was a graduate student in theological ethics at the time, but I knew I didn't want to get my Ph.D and do the academic grind. I didn't want to have to move across the country to scrape for whatever jobs I could find in the ridiculous world that is the academic humanities job market.

I also started to realize that people would actually pay decent money for a good web developer, so that's what I decided to become.

Since then I've done freelance and remote work for several clients and companies. I've built websites and apps of all different kinds.

I've greatly enjoyed my work, and I like to think I've gotten to be pretty good at it.

# Taking time off

My wife graduated with her computer science degree in 2014.

Soon after that, she got a job offer that would allow me to stay at home with our young son. This had the benefit of saving (a _lot_ of) money on childcare.

More than that, it gave me the ability to bond with him in ways I know would never have been possible had both of us needed to work full-time.

# Getting back to work

I plan to get back into paid web development work now that he's started school, but before I do I'm taking time to comprehensively assess my skills.

This means going back to the very beginning, starting with how to write a simple HTML element.

As I do so, I'm going to record my notes here so I have a resource to guide me from the simplest tasks to building complex projects.

This is the beginning of that resource.
